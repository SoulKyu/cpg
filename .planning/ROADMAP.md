# Roadmap: CPG (Cilium Policy Generator)

## Overview

CPG delivers a Go CLI tool that turns Hubble dropped flows into ready-to-apply CiliumNetworkPolicies. v1.0 shipped the core live-streaming generator. v1.1 added an offline iteration workflow (`cpg replay`), per-rule flow evidence, `cpg explain`, and `--dry-run` with unified YAML diff. v1.2 extended generation to L7 (HTTP + DNS) with two-step workflow guidance. Next milestone (v1.3) is awaiting scoping.

### 📋 v1.3 (Planned)

Scope to be locked via `/gsd:new-milestone`. Candidate themes carried over from v1.2 deferrals:

- `cpg apply` command (dry-run-default + `--force`)
- Policy consolidation across overlapping rules
- Prometheus metrics for long-running deployments
- HTTP path / FQDN auto-collapse heuristics (`--l7-collapse-paths`, `--l7-fqdn-wildcard-depth`)
- ToFQDNs from IP→name correlation (`DNS-FUT-03`)
- kube-dns selector autodetection across CNI distributions (EKS / GKE / AKS / vanilla)
- `--include-l7-forwarded` for DNS REFUSED denials surfaced as `Verdict_FORWARDED`
- `--min-flows-per-l7-rule N` low-confidence gate
- AI-assisted plausibility analysis (shelved before implementation — recoverable via git history)
