# Roadmap: CPG (Cilium Policy Generator)

## Overview

CPG delivers a Go CLI tool that turns Hubble dropped flows into ready-to-apply CiliumNetworkPolicies. v1.0 shipped the core live-streaming generator. v1.1 added an offline iteration workflow (`cpg replay`), per-rule flow evidence, `cpg explain`, and `--dry-run` with unified YAML diff. Next milestone (v1.2) extends generation to L7 (HTTP + DNS).

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP (Core Policy Generator)** — Phases 1-3 (shipped 2026-03-08) — [archive](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md)
- ✅ **v1.1 Offline Replay & Policy Analysis** — Phases 4-6 (shipped 2026-04-24) — [archive](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md)
- 🚧 **v1.2 L7 Policies** — focused on L7 HTTP + DNS policy generation. To be planned via `/gsd:new-milestone`.

### 🚧 v1.2 L7 Policies (Awaiting plan)

Scope locked to L7 only. Phases to be defined via `/gsd:new-milestone`.

**In scope:**
- L7 HTTP policy generation (method, path, headers as available in the Hubble L7 flow record)
- L7 DNS policy generation (FQDN matchPattern) from Hubble DNS flows
- Two-step workflow documented: deploy L4 first, observe L7, then enable L7 generation

**Deferred to v1.3 (or later):**
- `cpg apply` command
- Policy consolidation / merging
- Prometheus metrics
- AI-assisted plausibility analysis (shelved before implementation — design explored, see git history of `docs/superpowers/specs/`)
